# Basics
Creating Geometry Scripts can be as easy or complex as you want for your project.
Throughout this guide, scripts will be displayed alongside the generated nodes to provide context on how a script relates to the underlying nodes.

Setting up an editor for [external editing](../setup/external-editing.md) is recommended when writing scripts, but [internal editing inside Blender](../setup/internal-editing-basics.md) will suffice for the simple examples shown here.
